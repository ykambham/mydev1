#  Sample Input: [18,5,3,1,19,6,0,7,4,2,5]
#  Sample Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,18,19]
#
#  Time Complexity of Solution:
#  Best O(n^2); Average O(n^2); Worst O(n^2).
#
#  Approach:
#  Selection sort is a step up from insertion sort from a memory
#  viewpoint. It only swaps elements that need to be swapped. In terms
#  of time complexity, however, insertion sort is better.
