#  Time Complexity of Solution:
#  Best = Average = O(nlog(n)); Worst = O(n^2).
#
#  Approach:
#  Quicksort is admirably known as the algorithm that sorts an array
#  while preparing to sort it. For contrast, recall that merge sort
#  first partitions an array into smaller pieces, then sorts each piece,
#  then merge the pieces back. Quicksort actually sorts the array
#  during the partition phase.
#
#  Quicksort works by selecting an element called a pivot and splitting
#  the array around that pivot such that all the elements in, say, the
#  left sub-array are less than pivot and all the elements in the right
#  sub-array are greater than pivot. The splitting continues until the
#  array can no longer be broken into pieces. That's it. Quicksort is
#    done.
#
#  All this fussing about quicksort sorting while preparing to sort
#  may give the impression that it is better than mergesort, but its
#  not. In practice their time complexity is about the same -- with
#  one funny exception. Because quicksort picks its pivot randomly,
#  there is a practically impossible possibility that the algorithm
#    may take O(n^2) to compute.
#
#  The aforementioned notwithstanding, quicksort is better than
#    mergesort if you consider memory usage. Quicksort is an in-place
#    algorithm, requiring no additional storage to work.
